Reason/motivation for choosing this dataset: From my research and experience I found out that there are seasons sales are lower or higher than normal. If sales company like Tesco, Walmart, ShopRite (Nigeria) has no idea of these seasons, they will lose too much money. Predicting future sales is one of the most important aspect for a company. Sales forecasting gives an idea to the company for arranging stocks, calculating revenue, and deciding to make a new investment. Another advantage of knowing future sales is that achieving predetermined targets from the beginning of the seasons can have a positive effect on stock prices and investors' perceptions. Also, not reaching the projected target could significantly damage stock prices, conversely. And, it will be a big problem especially for big companies like Tesco, Walmart and ShopRite (Nigeria). In other to solve this problem. My aim in this project, Using the Walmart Datasets as a case study, is to build a model which predicts sales of the stores. With this model, these business organisations can decide their future plans which is very important for arranging stocks, calculating revenue and deciding to make new investment or not.
